# BetterWeb – Adaptation Made Easy

A powerful Chrome extension designed to make the internet more accessible for users with ADHD, dyslexia, sensory sensitivities, visual impairments, and other cognitive conditions.

## 📌 Tagline

**Adaptation Made Easy.** Personalise the web in real-time with AI-powered accessibility.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

The web today isn't built for everyone. Millions of users with cognitive and sensory disabilities are excluded by rigid, inaccessible design. This limits access to education, services, and opportunities.
